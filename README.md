# Gulika-kalam-Yamagandam-and-Rahukalam-Calculator-based-on-Location
A Python program using Geopy and Suntime module to calculate Yamagandam, Gulika kalam, and Rahu kalam in Indian Standard Time.

### Gulika kalam (Good time in Sanskrit)** is auspicious time of day, accepted for starting things or doing good deeds.

### Yamagandam ('Danger of Hell') and Rahu Kalam ('Devil's or Dark time') is considered inauspicious time of the day. Each lasting 1.5 hours and recurrs daily in routine. Just like yin-yang the good and bad times alternate endlessly till infinity.

Yamagandam, Rahu Kalam, and Gulika Kalam are astrological concepts followed in some Indian traditions, particularly in Vedic astrology and Muhurtha (electional astrology). Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Yamagandam:** Yamagandam is a 90-minute time period that occurs every day and is considered inauspicious. It is calculated based on the weekday and the sunrise time. Activities started during Yamagandam are believed to be less likely to succeed or may encounter obstacles.

2. **Rahu Kalam:** Rahu Kalam is another 90-minute period that varies each day and is considered inauspicious. It is determined by the planetary position of Rahu. During Rahu Kalam, important activities like starting new ventures or journeys are often avoided due to the belief that they may not yield positive results.

3. **Gulika Kalam:** Gulika Kalam is also a 90-minute time slot that changes daily and is considered inauspicious. It is calculated based on the planetary position of Gulika, a hypothetical point in Vedic astrology. Activities initiated during Gulika Kalam are believed to bring negative outcomes or obstacles.

Many people in India consult astrologers or almanacs to determine these timings and plan their activities accordingly. However, it's important to note that the belief in these timings is cultural and rooted in traditional astrology, and not everyone follows them.
